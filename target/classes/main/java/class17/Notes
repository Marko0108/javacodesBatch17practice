Inheritance:
- allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another class except private members and constructors.
We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about inheritance:
1) Faster development
2) Saves memory

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    }

    class Child extends Parent{

    }

Rules:
1) Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
1) Single Inheritance
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Hybrid
5) Multiple(It is not supported by Java)

Single - Only one parent and only one child (Not very common)
Hierarchical - one parent multiple child
Multilevel - happens when a class C inherits from B and B inherits from A
Hybrid - is a mixture of hierarchical and multilevel
Multiple - multiple parent classes and one child class
public class CatDog extends Dog,Cat{}   - multiple inheritance not allowed in java meaning a class can't
inherent from classes at the same time - diamond problem
What is Diamond problem in OOP? (interview question)
     The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and a further class D
     inherits from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
     and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
