Object oriented programming:
Its just a way(Set of rules) of writing code.
It basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easier to change and manage.
There are other ways like functional programming and procedural programming.

Why we should ude OOP?
1) it helps us write large amounts of code easily
2) it also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily
3) changing code becomes easier.
4) sharing code and collaboration becomes easier

Main concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
1) classes and objects (base not considered main pillar)
2) inheritance
3) polymorphism
4) abstraction
5) encapsulation

Classes and objects:
A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start building the actual object.
Classes have properties/attributes which help us figure out how something looks like and they have behaviours/functions
which helps us understand how something works
