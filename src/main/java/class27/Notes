File

File is something that we use to store information.

File handling:
1)txt files are used to store raw text
2)pdf files are usually used to store books and articles
3)xlsx files are usually used to store information in the form of a table
4).jpg .jpeg .png files are used to store images
5).mp4 .mkv .mov are used to store videos
Why we use files?
    Its easier to move the information around because it just one single file.
Folders/Directories:
    Its like a container for files. It can contain many different files.
    We use it to organize the information.


File Handling:
    File is creating/editing/accessing/deleting the files on a computer with the help of a programing language.

Steps to work with file
    1) to locate the file usually we use absolute path
    for example "C:/users/syntax/desktop/batch17/names.txt"
    2)We need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open that file.
    3)to bring files from permanent storage into the RAM
What is RAM?
    Temporary storage its very fast but very expensive and does not store data permanently
    Once we turn off the computer everything that we put in the RAM is gone.
What is HDD/SDD/NVME/Storage:
    Its the permanent storage that we use to store thing its cheap but slow.
Why should we learn about FileHandling?
    1)So that we can store the data permanent
    2)We can store the sensitive data like userNames passwords etc inside the files and keep them secure on our
     computers and don't push it with code on github.
    3)All the configuration related information like URLS and types of testing will also be sored in the files
