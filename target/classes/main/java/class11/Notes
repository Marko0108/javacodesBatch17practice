String class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,d,C), numbers(10,25),
    special characters(#,$,%) in the form of a group. There are many methods already written
    by java developers that we can just use. This is the most widely used class in java.
    For example:
    length()
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()

Why we should learn about this class
   1) Very important for coding questions
   2) Most widely used class in all java
   3) Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings

Method Changing:
    when multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method changing
    String class supports method changing for method changing to work previous method must return the expected
     datatype for the next method.





   Note:
   Very important for coding questions for interviews
1) If else
2) Loops
3) Arrays
4) Strings
