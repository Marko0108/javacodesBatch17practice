What is file?
    Files are entities/objects that we use to store the data permanently.
File Handling:
    Reading/writing/managing the files using code is called fileHandling.
As a tester:
    you will use .properties file
     excel files sometimes and .csv f
    we store configuration related data in .properties file for example usernames, password, urls, the name of the
    browser on which you want to preform testing
What data we store in excel files?
    1) we store the results of testing
    2) we store the data related to web forms inside excel. It is usually done when we need a lot of data to test
    a website.
    It is called Data Driven testing.
Steps to work with a file:
    1) location/path on the computer
    2) bring the data from a file into RAM
    3) specific software/classes which understands how that file works.
