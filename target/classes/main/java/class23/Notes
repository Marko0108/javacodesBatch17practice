Encapsulation:
    It is pne pf the four fundamental OOP concepts. It is create classes to write code and store data.
    Use private access modifiers to secure the data by limiting the access.
    Create getter setter methods for every field if you want others to change or see those fields.
Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    It improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class which leads us to more secure code.
Collections framework:
    Collection framework in java contains a lot of classes and interfaces.
    Which help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily and efficiently.
Why Collection framework:
    Arrays have limitations
    1) They are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we can't change it afterwards.
    2) They don't have any built-in methods to help us process the data.
