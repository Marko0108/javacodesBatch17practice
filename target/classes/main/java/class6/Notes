Operators:
   Operators are symbol witch perform an opertion on data.
   There are many different types of operators in java.
Aritmetic operators:
   These operators help us perform simple mathematical operators like
Adition        => +   int a=10 int b=20 int c=b+b; =>30
Subtraction    => -
Multiplication => *
Division       => /
Modulus        => %
Shorthand operators:
   They help us perform mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
   add and update the variable  +=  int a=10 a+=20 =>30
   subtract and update the variable += int a=10 a-=20 =>-10
   multiply and update the variable *= int a=10 a*=20 =>200
   divide and update the variable /* int a=10 a/=20 =>0
   modulus and update the variable % int a=10 a%=20 =>10
Relational Operators
   These operators help us compare things.
   == checks it two objects are equal
   != checks it two objects are not equal
   > great than
   < less than
   >= greater than equal
   <= less than equal
Logical operators:
   They help us combine multiple boolean conditions
   ! Not
   || Or
   && And
Increment/Decrement operators.
  ++ this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
  -- this will help us decrease the value of a variable by one

  Note:
  While loop checks the condition first then execute the code.
  Do while on the other hand execute the code first and then checks the condition.
  There are no other differences and reasons to use a do while insead of while
