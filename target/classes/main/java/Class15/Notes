Constructors
- help us build objects from classes easily.
They help us give initial values to the instance fields. The name of the constructor must be same as the class nae.
Constructors don't have any return types. Most of the time constructors are public.
Other then initializing the values we can have whatever type of code inside the constructor that we like
 for example calling methods writing if-else etc.

 Class ClassName{
 String name;
 public ClassName(){

 }

 public ClassName(){

 }

 }
