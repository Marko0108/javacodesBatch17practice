Maps:
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs.
    There are many different types of maps in Java but we will be discussing
    1)HashMap 2)LikedHashMap 3)TreeMap 4)HashTable
    Maps are not part of the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and HashMap, LinkedHasMap,
    TreeMap and HashTable are the classes that implement this interface.
Why we should learn about Maps?
    All the other datastructures that we have learnt can only store one value at a time are indexed based.
    Maps allow us to store key value pairs which makes the a better choice because we know what we are storing.
Syntax of Maps:
    NameOfTheClass<DataType>variableName=new NameOfTheClass<>();
    ArrayList<String> names=new ArrayList<>();
    HashMap<String,Double> names= new HashMap<>();
