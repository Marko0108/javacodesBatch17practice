Method Overloading:  (interview question)
    Method Overloading happens when multiple methods with same name but with different parameters.
    1) Different number of parameters for example min(2,3) min(4,5,6)
    2) Different datatype of methods  print("Java") print(12);
    3) Different sequence/order of parameters print ("Java",12), print(12,"Java")

Why should we learn about method overloading:
1) Cleaner code
2) We don't need to come up with different method names

Syntax:
class Calculator{
int add(int a, int b){
return a+b;
}
int addThreeNumbers(int a, int b, int c){
return a+b+c;
}

double addDouble(double a, double b){
return a+b;
}

long addLong(long a, long b){
return a+b;
}
}
For Method Overloading we don't need inheritance
For Method Overriding we  need inheritance

MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverriding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as in child class.


Note:
    Signature of a method:
        method name plus its parameters are called signature of a method.
    Header of a method includes signature plus return type plus access modifier

Topics to revise for Selenium!!!

    1)classes and objects
    2)methods
    3)string methods
    4)loops
    5)if-else

Approach:
1) Read slides if something is not clear watch short videos from youtube for that specific topic
2) Solve your HW/Repl again


every method can be overloaded interview question!!
