SuperKeyword:
    SuperKeyword refers to parent class. We can use super-keyword to access variables, methods and constructors
     from the parent class.
Why we should use super keyword?
    1) to specifically call something from parent class, like variable or methods
             (private fields and private methods cannot be called)
    2) we can use super() to call the constructor from the parent
MethodOverloading:
    1) When we have same method with different parameters its called method overloading.
    Parameters can be different in 3 ways.
        1) we can change the count of the parameters. We can overload methods as well as constructors.
        2) we can also change the datatype of parameters if number of parameters are same.
        3) we can change the sequence if datatype and number of parameters are same
Why?
    1) cleaner code: We don't have to come up with different method names
    2) reuse: same name can be reused many times
Interview question?
    Can we overload a private method?  Yes
    2) Can we overload a static method? Yes
    3) Can we overload the main method? Yes
    4) Can we overload a method by changing its return type? No
    5) Can we overload a protected method? Yes

MethodOverriding:
    When same method is present in parent as well as child class its called method overriding.
    When we override a method Java prefers the method from the child class.
Why?
