Methods/Functions/Behaviours/routines

        methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
        when we call a methods

There are two main types of methods:
    1) Methods witch do not return any data(void type)
    2) Methods witch can return data like int double char etc

Syntax:

datatype methodName (dataType nameOfParameter, dataType nameOfOtherParam){
this is where we write the logic

return the result if method type is not void
}

int add(int num1, int num2){
            int result=num1+num2;

            return result;
            }

int=> return type of method
add=> name of the method
(int num1, int num2) => parameters
                      =>>>> Body of the method
                                       int result = num1+num2
