Logical Operators:

- help us combine multiple conditions on the same line in if statements.
There are three types of logical operators:
NOT(!)
OR (||)
AND(&&)

NOT(!):
true=>false
false=>true

Why should we use NOT operator:
1) it can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
2) code readability will increase

OR (||):
Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple condition in such a way that as soon as one conditiongets true the whole condition will be evaluated to true
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
true||true||true=>true

AND(&&)
Logical AND operator will help us combine the condition in such a way that it will only give us true if all the condition are true
true && False && true =>false
true && true && true  =>true
true && true && false => false
