Types of variables:
    There are three types of variables: local, instance and static.
1) local variables - variables which are created declared inside a block of code, like if else conditions,
 loop, switch statements, methods are block of code.
 Upside:
 They occupy the memory for shortest period of time. As soon as java is done executing that block of code
  they are removed from the memory.
  The code that we write using local variable is very easy to debug.
 Downside:
 They can only be accessed within the block of code they are created.

 2)Instance variables - variables which are created outside of the block (if else, switch, loops or methods etc.)
  of code but inside a class
  Upside:
  They can be accessed anywhere within the that class.
  Downside:
  They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory as long as that object
  is in the memory weather you use them or not.

  Local vs instance:
    Whenever it is possible go and create local variables.
    Only go with instance variables when you cant solve a problem with local variables.

  3) Static variables - are created inside a class but outside of block of code with a static keyword.
  Upside:
  They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility. We don't even need to created the object of that class
  in which they are created we can simply write the name of the class and we can access it.
  Downside:
  Static variables occupy the memory for longest of all.
  They are created even though you don't create any object of the class.

  Uses of types of local variables:
  Local:
        Whenever we are solving any problem many times we need local variables to temporally store data.
        In all of those cases you should be going with local variables.
