Set:
    Sets are special set of classes which do not allow duplicate elements.
    Set is the main interface amd there are three main classes which implement this interface.
    1)HashSet
    2)LinkedHashSet
    3)TreeSet
HashSet:
    UpSide: Its fastest of all.
    DownSide: It does not remember the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Maintains the insertion order.
    DownSide: It's a little slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Upside: Keeps the data in sorted form.
    DownSide: Insertion is very very slow.
Maps:
    Maps is an interface that allows us to store key value pairs.
